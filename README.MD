### Dushin program supports all gaussian versions from g94 to g16

This is the modified version of dushin program for decomposition of reorganization energy. The program supports all gaussian versions from 94 to 16.



#### Compilation:

* The current version only supports ifort from intel compiler 
* cd to the dushin dir
* module load intel-compiler/2021.1.1 
* make all 

#### Run the program

Please have a look at the example to prepare input files

* The program needs: log outputs from Gaussian, fchk obtained using formchk input.chk 
* An example input is provided in the examples directory 

#### Leave comments in issues to have more support from me.

I do not have free time to explain how to use Dushin program to calculate internal reorganization energy from harmonic vibrational modes. Leave comments in Issues, and there will be support.
